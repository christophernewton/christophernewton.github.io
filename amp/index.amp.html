		<h1>Chris Newton Portfolio</h1>
		<h2>31 Year old guy who likes to make <strong>cool</strong> looking, <strong>functionally</strong> amazing, <strong>super fast</strong> websites</h2>

			<h1>Nintendo</h1>
			<p>Working with a team of 7 people, together we built a new site from the ground up using Core dna. My responsibilities for this project include </p>
			<ul>
				<li>communicating with marketing and design teams. </li>
				<li>code standards and quality assurance</li>
				<li>delegating tasks to remote employees</li>
				<li>making sure time lines are kept</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This project launched in multiple phases with the homepage, Wii U and 3ds pages launching first and then continuing work on support, help and games catalogue.</p>
			<p>The approval process was lengthy with each phase so management of branches and sandboxes were key to making sure each phase launched successfully.</p>

			<h1>Mornington Peninsula Tourism</h1>
			<p>Rebuilding their new tourism site with a fresh and bright design I had a lot of creative freedom to add some cool animations to the design that was handed to us.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This is a very content heavy website with a lot of large imagery so finding the balance between load times and the client wanting to show off their assets was priority.</p>

			<h1>Rivalea</h1>
			<p>This started out as an experiment by the marketing team at Rivalea and moved into a bit more of a micro site.</p>
			<p>There was a lot of creative freedoms given in this project with the only real direction given was that they wanted a horizontal scrolling website.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Setting positions based on active states using hashbangs, knowing what I know now I would have approached it differently.</p>
			<p>Originally this was meant to be a static site but it was ported half way through into Dot Net Nuke so some of the code needed to be re-factored to allow this.</p>
